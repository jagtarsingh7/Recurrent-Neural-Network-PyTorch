# Project4 - Recurrent Neural Network with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch for image classification.

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of:
- Loading and preprocessing an image dataset
- Defining an RNN model architecture
- Training the RNN model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Visualizing loss and accuracy during training

## Contents
- [Notebook](assignment4.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for dataset loading, RNN model definition, training, and evaluation.
- [Datasets](assignment4Datasets/): Sample dataset files used for training and testing.

## Prerequisites
- Python [version]
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook assignment4.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to explore the RNN image classifier implementation.

## Usage
- The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on dataset loading, RNN model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- Run each cell in the notebook to see the implementation in action.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures to improve performance.

## Results and Discussion
